[{"content":" This is just a write up on resolving picoCTF(2021) Glory of the Garden challenge.\nFirst I tried running exiftool which showed me the metadata of the photo where I noticed that the lines with the following:\n1 2 3 Red Tone Reproduction Curve : (Binary data 2060 bytes, use -b option to extract) Green Tone Reproduction Curve : (Binary data 2060 bytes, use -b option to extract) Blue Tone Reproduction Curve : (Binary data 2060 bytes, use -b option to extract) Meaning the photo has son binary data attached to it, now the question is\nHow do I extract that data? After some digging on Youtube School I found various ways to do it\nThe challenge hint it is about using a hex editor which it will help you extract the data. Using that method you will have to scroll and found the flag.\nUsing strings command The first way and the most easy one is using strings command. Using this command it will show you only the ASCII representation of the strings inside the binary data of the image.\nstrings - print the sequences of printable characters in files\nCommand:\n1 strings garden.jpg Output:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 .... %zR} Tw1\u0026lt;Oi yg9S F7v] m o5Xex# V8L; \u0026lt;]zV\u0026amp; ZqKvu 7g4js\u0026#39; wae:uc(\u0026gt;YwG 6 `A xhS~ wM=GV gDau%~ ,~J| u)(])F ={~5 h--@3 cZi- M(.I ]hWP\u0026amp; jc#k =7g\u0026amp; mjx/ s\\]|.\u0026#34;Ue \\qZf -------------- Here is a flag \u0026#34;picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y3eBdBd2cc}\u0026#34; -------------- Using xxd command The second way to do it will be using the xxd command. Using it will start dumping in to the shell all the hex data of the image including the flag.\nxxd creates a hex dump of a given file or standard input. It can also convert a hex dump back to\nits original binary form. Like uuencode(1) and uudecode(1) it allows the transmission of binary data in a `mail-safe' ASCII representation, but has the advantage of decoding to standard output. Moreover, it can be used to perform binary file patching.

And that\u0026rsquo;s it !! got the flag but not stopping I kept looking around the internet and found some extra steps to make the output of the strings fancier, Like only printing the flag passingtail command to the pipeline or getting only the flag without the extra text passing the cut command or making a simple bash script to automate everything.\nExtra steps: Passing the tail command to the pipeline What does the tail command do?\ntail - Print the last 10 lines of each FILE to standard output. With more than one FILE, precede each with a header giving the file name.\n-n, --lines=[+]NUM output the last NUM lines, instead of the last 10; or use -n +NUM to output starting with line NUM Since the flag is on the last line of the data I passed the following to the pipeline\n1 tail -n 1 Now the strings command should look like this:\n1 strings garden.jpg | tail -n 1 and the Output:\n1 Here is a flag \u0026#34;picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y3eBdBd2cc}\u0026#34; Passing the cut command to the pipeline What does the cut command do?\ncut - remove sections from each line of files Print selected parts of lines from each FILE to standard output. - d, \u0026ndash;delimiter=DELIM\nuse DELIM instead of TAB for field delimiter - f, --fields=LIST select only these fields; also print any line that contains no delimiter character, unless the -s option is specified So as you can see the entire string has \u0026ldquo;Here is a flag\u0026rdquo; and the flag is surrounded by \u0026quot;\u0026quot; so using the -d and -f come in handy to tell the command what part of the string I want so by passing -d flag like this:\n1 -d \u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#39; this way the cut command it\u0026rsquo;ll be set (\u0026quot;) as the delimiter to split the string into fields, the double quotes is used to separate and distinguish one section of text from another within a larger body of text and the way cut -d works the -f flags needs to be specified or else will throw this error:\n1 cut: you must specify a list of bytes, characters, or fields So the way to do this is finding on what field is the flag cut works kind of like this:\n1 2 Here is the Flag \u0026#34;picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y3eBdBd2cc}\u0026#34; |______1________| |___________________2____________________| When cut processes the input string, it splits it into fields based on the delimiter. In the case of the string Here is the Flag \u0026ldquo;picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y3eBdBd2cc}\u0026rdquo;, the delimiter (\u0026quot;) occurs twice in the string, so cut splits it into three fields:\n1 2 3 1. `Here is the flag` 2. \u0026#34;picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y3eBdBd2cc}\u0026#34; 3. empty field After cut has split the input string into fields, you can use the -f option to specify which fields you want to keep. In this case, we want to keep the second field, which contains the flag. So we use the -f 2 option to tell cut to keep only the second field.\nSo, the -d \u0026lsquo;\u0026quot;\u0026rsquo; option is not removing the double quotes from the fields. Rather, it is specifying the character that should be used as the delimiter to separate the input string into fields. The full command should look like this now:\nCommand:\n1 strings garden.jpg | tail -n 1 | cut -d \u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#39; -f2 Output:\n1 picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y3eBdBd2cc} And to automate all this I just pasted the command into a bash file so instead of writing all that line all I have to do is run the file and pass the name of the photo. So as for the file just create an .sh file and paste the code but instead of specifying the photo name I change for a positional parameter so it can be run this way:\n1 ./\u0026lt;filename\u0026gt;.sh garden.jpg So the modified command looks like this:\n1 2 #!/bin/bash strings \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; | tail -n 1 | cut -d \u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#39; -f2 In this updated command, $1 is a positional parameter that refers to the first argument passed to the script when it is executed. So, if you execute the script with the command ./bashfile.sh garden.jpg, then $1 will be replaced with garden.jpg in the script. This allows you to run the script with different image file names without having to edit the script itself.\n","date":"2023-03-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://lonusu.com/p/extracting-the-binary-data-from-a-photo/coding-hero_hu4f494a07e43c3ee16cd684f59d8c928d_83487_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://lonusu.com/p/extracting-the-binary-data-from-a-photo/","title":"Extracting the binary data from a photo"},{"content":"Overview You are here for a reason\nYou want to self host your own site but you don\u0026rsquo;t have a public IP and you can\u0026rsquo;t pay your ISP for one because you\u0026rsquo;re poor.

To end the process simply do ctrl + c.\nKnown issues If you are running Ghost on an older PC its probably that at the moment you want to upload any image (profile picture or post image) Ghost will silently crash and this is probably because your CPU doesn\u0026rsquo;t support SSE4.2.\nThis due to the sharp dropped support on older CPU that are running below SSE4.2\nSo a Fix is disabling the imageOptimization to do this add the following to your conf.production.json\n1 2 3 4 \u0026#34;imageOptimization\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;resize\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;srcsets\u0026#34;: false } After doing you should be able to upload images to your site BUT since you disabled imageOptimization ghost is going to crash after you upload the Publication cover image so keep in mind that.\n","date":"2022-06-15T00:00:00Z","image":"https://lonusu.com/p/how-to-install-host-ghost-with-cloudflare-argo-tunnel/cloudflared-ghost_hu7136eeb6509210a4b2b53073df7006c6_75676_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://lonusu.com/p/how-to-install-host-ghost-with-cloudflare-argo-tunnel/","title":"How to install \u0026 host Ghost with Cloudflare Argo tunnel"},{"content":"What you need: 1 - OBS studio\n2 - win-capture-audio, this is the program you need to split the audio. You can download it here :\nhttps://github.com/bozbez/win-capture-audio/releases/download/v2.2.2-beta/win-capture-audio-2.2.2-beta-setup.exe\nInstallation and Usage Once you downloaded the program run the installer (make sure OBS is not open) it\u0026rsquo;s a fast installation once it finish you can launch OBS now if you add a new source there should be a new option called Application Audio Output Capture\nAdding the audio sources: Since you can add multiple programs to the same source I recommend creating a source specially for each type of group for example did it like this:\nThe Music - Audio group it\u0026rsquo;s a must since here is where you\u0026rsquo;re going to add the programs that bring music to the stream like Spotify or Google chrome(nightbot/youtube) and its gonna allow to separate it from the VOD audio track.\nAlso to avoid having to add each audio source to different scenes a good trick is creating a new scene and there add all the audio sources groups you\u0026rsquo;re gonna use and once you are done with setting up everything all you have to do is add that scene as a source in the multiple scenes that you use so every time you add a new group of audio sources it automatically adds them to the mixer of each scene.\nAdd your programs: Here you have to ways to add programs/games.\nAdd from currently active sessions menu: In this menu it should give you a list with the most common program. (ex: Discord, Spotify) and some others that the plugin might detect. Once you selected the program just click in the Add Executable. You can add multiple programs as a group to the same audio source.\nUsing the + next to the executables area: If the program you want to add to a certain group of sources doesn\u0026rsquo;t show up in the Session menu you might wanna added the program executable manually. For example if you want to add Google Chrome and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t show up in the list you add it by clicking in the + button and type chrome.exe and press ok and it should be added to the Executables area.\nIMPORTANT !! : SINCE OBS IS CREATING AUDIO TOO BECAUSE YOU HAVE CLIPS/ALERTS AND SUCH THINGS AS BROWSER SOURCE INSIDE OBS YOU SHOULD ADD OBS ITSELF AS AN AUDIO SOURCE SO VIEWERS GET TO HEAR THEM ON STREAM\nIf the program you want to add doesn\u0026rsquo;t show up in the Session menu and you have to manually add it but you dont know whats the name of the executable you can get it in the task manager in the details tab. (Open it by pressing Windows key + type taksmngr and it should be the first option) there you can see all the programs executable names. (ex: chrome.exe). Most of the time the executable is programname.exe but sometimes its different.(ex: for Apex Legends is r5apex.exe).\nNOTE - League of Legends:\nFor league you have to add two sources LeagueClientUxRender.exe and League of Legends.exe the first one is for the league client audio and the second one is for when youre inside the game audio. Both should automatically appear in the session menu when you open the client and when you get in a game. (you can set up the second by going into a custom game/practice tool).\nTelling Twitch which applications audio you want to get saved in the VOD audio: Inside OBS settings you want to change the Output mode from simple to advanced once you do this you should see the Twitch VOD Track option under the Audio Track select the checkbox and by default it has the track 2 you can leave it as it is or change it, up to you. Just keep in mind that it should not be the same as the Audio Track.\nDisabling audio track : Once you have the option enabled and all your audio sources added the next step disabling the track 2 to the sources that you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be saved in the VOD.\nRemember the Music - Audio source we created before here it\u0026rsquo;s why we need it to be like that.\nFor this you click in the cog wheel of any audio source and go to Advanced Audio Properties.\nThen a new window should pop-up and it should show you all the audio sources and their audio tracks\nSee how we have multiple numbers and check boxes in Tracks. Remember that by default Twitch VOD Track that is selected in Settings is the track 2, since we don\u0026rsquo;t want Twitch to save ourMusic - Audio in the VOD what we do is we uncheck the track 2 from Music - Audio or any other audio source you want to exclude from the VOD.\nNote: Only uncheck the track that you selected as your twitch vod track because if you uncheck any other track not only it wont get recorded in the VOD, viewers won\u0026rsquo;t be able to listen to that source on stream.\nNow from now on your vods should not record any music source.\n","date":"2022-06-11T00:00:00Z","image":"https://lonusu.com/p/obs-split-audio-guide/obs-studio_hu852487be308eca7c1a54a1172628f88e_105789_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpeg","permalink":"https://lonusu.com/p/obs-split-audio-guide/","title":"OBS Split Audio Guide"},{"content":"This article offers a sample of basic Markdown syntax that can be used in Hugo content files, also it shows whether basic HTML elements are decorated with CSS in a Hugo theme.\nHeadings The following HTML \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;—\u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; elements represent six levels of section headings. \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; is the highest section level while \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; is the lowest.\nH1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6 Paragraph Xerum, quo qui aut unt expliquam qui dolut labo.
